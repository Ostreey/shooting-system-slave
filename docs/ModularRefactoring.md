# Modular Refactoring Summary

The main.cpp file has been successfully refactored from a single monolithic file (~1200 lines) into a clean modular structure. This improves readability, maintainability, and testability of the codebase.

## New File Structure

### Core Files Created:

1. **`src/Config.h`** - Centralized configuration and constants
   - BLE UUIDs and service definitions
   - GPIO pin assignments
   - Timing constants
   - ADC and PWM configurations

2. **`src/LEDController.h/.cpp`** - LED control functionality
   - RGB LED control with brightness support
   - PWM setup and management
   - Predefined color functions
   - LED effects (blinking, status indication)

3. **`src/PowerManager.h/.cpp`** - Power and battery management
   - Battery percentage calculation and monitoring
   - Deep sleep and wake-up validation
   - Charging detection
   - Auto-sleep functionality
   - Button press detection

4. **`src/OTAManager.h/.cpp`** - Over-The-Air update functionality
   - OTA service setup and management
   - Firmware upload and verification
   - OTA state tracking and error handling
   - BLE characteristic callbacks for OTA commands/data

5. **`src/BLEManager.h/.cpp`** - Bluetooth Low Energy communication
   - BLE server and service setup
   - Command parsing and handling
   - Data transmission (piezo values, battery levels)
   - Connection state management

6. **`src/main.cpp`** - Simplified main application (now ~120 lines)
   - Module initialization and coordination
   - Main event loop
   - Callback function implementations

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Improved Maintainability**
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to locate and fix bugs
- Simplified testing of individual components

### 2. **Better Code Organization**
- Related functionality grouped together
- Clear dependencies between modules
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper encapsulation

### 3. **Enhanced Readability**
- Much shorter main.cpp file
- Self-documenting module names
- Clear public interfaces
- Reduced cognitive load when reading code

### 4. **Easier Extension**
- New features can be added to specific modules
- Less risk of breaking existing functionality
- Clear integration points for new components

## Module Dependencies

```
main.cpp
├── Config.h (used by all modules)
├── LEDController (no dependencies)
├── PowerManager (depends on LEDController)
├── OTAManager (minimal dependencies)
└── BLEManager (depends on all other modules)
```

## Initialization Order

The modules are initialized in dependency order:
1. LEDController (needed by other modules)
2. PowerManager (needs LED for status indication)
3. PiezoSensor (hardware interface)
4. BLEManager (coordinates with all other modules)
5. Background tasks (battery monitoring, LED status)

## Migration Notes

- All original functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to external interfaces
- Original BLE commands and responses unchanged
- Power management behavior identical
- OTA functionality fully compatible

## Future Improvements

With this modular structure, future enhancements could include:
- Unit testing for individual modules
- Mock implementations for testing
- Configuration file support
- Plugin architecture for new sensor types
- Web interface module
- Data logging module
